## Introduction

The Auro MVVM app is created to provide an example of how to structure Flutter applications using the MVVM architectural pattern. The primary focus of this project was to practice and implement:
- MVVM architecture.
- Clean architecture principles.
- Separation of concerns.

## Features

- Demonstrates the MVVM architectural pattern.
- Separation of UI, business logic, and data layers.
- Clean and maintainable code structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The core framework for developing the app.
- **Provider**: Used for state management.
- **HTTP**: Used for making API calls.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedNasserZakii/Auro-MVVM.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   cd Auro-MVVM
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Explore MVVM Implementation:**
   - Understand how MVVM is implemented in the app.
   - Explore the separation of UI, business logic, and data layers.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a modular approach, making it easier to manage and scale:

```css
lib/
├── models/
├── viewmodels/
├── views/
├── services/
├── utils/
├── main.dart
```
- **models/**: Contains data models.
- **viewmodels/**: Contains ViewModel classes.
